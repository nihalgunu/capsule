- When we click on a city, i want to see where it is on the map. Need to bold it and make it appearent
- stop using text as a form of information deliever unless aboslutely vital ie summarizations we want to visually show things to the user
- when an orange location is clicked the user should see "people" in an environment conveying informationetc ie the same information getting conveyed in text
- when a user makes a change we should render the world moving/changing because of that change. take advatadge of batch text generation/parsing text generation to show the change happening in the world while we continue to get the rest of the output etc
batch inferencing. their shouldnt have to be any explicit loading screens.
