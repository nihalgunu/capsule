## **6. Problem Statements**

In this hackathon, we would like you to leverage Google’s AI products to create breakthrough experiences across music, TV, film, and gaming. Your project must build in at least **one** of the three required tracks.

### **1. Gemini and Music**

Use Gemini to build real-time, personalized music experiences that evolve based on listener input, biometric data, or environmental context.

### **2. Gemini and Film**

Leverage **Gemini** to create non-linear narratives and AI-native production tools that redefine the boundary between creator and audience.

### **3. Gemini and Gaming: THIS IS WHAT WE ARE DOING**

Utilize **Gemini’s long-context window** to build persistent, intelligent game worlds where NPCs and environments exhibit genuine agency and evolving memory.

## **10. Judging & Submissions**

Judges will be taking place on **Saturday, February 28th**. These judges are evaluating your **technical demos** in the following categories. *Show us what you have built* to solve our problem statements. Please **do not** show us a presentation. We'll be checking to ensure your project was built **entirely during the event**; no previous work is allowed. 

**Judging Criteria**

1. **Impact (25%) —** What is the project’s long-term potential for success, growth and impact? Does it fit into one of the problem statements listed above? Is the project useful, and for who?

2. **Demo (50%) —** How well has the team implemented the idea? Does it work?

3. **Creativity (15%) —** Is the project’s concept innovative? Is their demo unique?

4. **Pitch (10%) *—*** How effectively does the team present their project?

**Judging Process**

**|** Judging proceeds in two rounds:

- Hackers will be assigned groups of judges; \~3 minutes to pitch followed by 1-2 minutes of Q/A

- The top **six** teams in ranking will get to demo on stage to a panel of judges; \~3 minutes to pitch followed by 2-3 minutes for Q/A.
